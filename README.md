<p><strong>Single Page Application</strong></p>
<p><strong>Category:</strong> SPA (MERN-stack)</p>
<p><strong>Project date:</strong> February 2021</p>
<p><strong>Project URL:</strong> https://secure-plateau-66948.herokuapp.com/</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong>
  This project has been done in different ways. First I did this single page application using old ways of React - using class-based 
  methods. Then I refactored the project to use React hooks. Due to prop drilling and App.js being very messy - I refactored the project for the third time. This 
  time I used Context API to make the app structure much clearer.

<ul>
  <li>React v16.8+ w/ hooks</li>
